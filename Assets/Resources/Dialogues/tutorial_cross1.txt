Press|Press2.3

Emot|Thinking

Press|3.9
Name|Yin Yang
Text|Bad enunciation aside, I think you'll find this is very important information.  You can request that this be added to the testimony. That way, you can investigate further.

Emot|Confident

PressAdded|Press4.4
Name|Judge
Text|And are you calling yourself to the stand then?
Emot|Curious

PressAdded|Press4.5
Name|Yin Yang
Text|That would be a highly unconventional tactic.  But even if you did, unless you could prove that you have a perfect memory, and met with everybody in your entire school, it doesn't PROVE that he wasn't there.
Emot|Serious

PressAdded|Press4.6
Name|Diana Vine
Text|But, but, but... I KNOW he wasn't there!
Emot|Shocked

PressAdded|Press4.7
Name|Yin Yang
Text|And - unofficially, mind you - I believe you.  But this court isn't founded on memory and opinions, it's founded on factual evidence.  Take a look at your EVIDENCE.  Once you find the information that proves he wasn't at your high school, you can PRESENT it to the court.
Emot|Friendly

PressAdded|Press4.8
Name|Diana Vine
Text|(Alright, I can do this.  Find the EVIDENCE and PRESENT it. It's got to be here!)
Emot|Determined

Cross|Cross5

Emot|Serious

Press|Press5.1
Name|Diana Vine
Text|And how did she warn you?  Clairvoyance is one-way!
Emot|Smug

Press|Press5.2
Name|Robin Banks
Text|We had walkie-talkies.
Emot|Happy

Cross|Cross6
Name|Robin Banks
Text|We subdue the guard at the front, and move in to take out the second guard.  Things went a lil' sideways, an’ Battery shot the guard.
Emot|Upset

Press|Press6.1

Emot|Confused

Press|Press6.2
Name|Robin Banks
Text|Tha's lingo fer when things go bad.  See's, we didn' want to shot no guard.
Emot|Thinking

Press|Press6.3

Text|But you did shoot the guard.
Emot|Determined

Press|Press6.4
Name|Robin Banks
Text|Well, not me.  I told ya, it was Battery, what shot him.
Emot|Embarrassed

Press|Press6.5
Name|Diana Vine
Text|And then he's lying sideways.  Is that why it's called that?
Emot|Thinking

Press|Press6.6
Name|Robin Banks
Text|Nah, that ain't it.  It's like, if yer movin' towards yer goal, that's good.  But then suddenly, yer movin' sideways, an yer not gettin any closer.  In fact, yer gettin further away, geometrically speakin'.
Emot|Thinking

Press|Press6.7
Name|Diana Vine
Text|(How does a guy like this even know the word "geometrically"?)
Emot|Annoyed

Cross|Cross7
Name|Robin Banks
Text|So we grabbed the loot and fled the scene.
Emot|Serious

Press|Press7.1
Name|Diana Vine

Emot|Thinking

Diag|Conclusion2
Name|Diana Vine

Emot|Thinking

Diag|Conclusion3
Name|Diana Vine
Text|First I need to PRESS the witness until I get more information...
Emot|Thinking

Diag|Conclusion4
Name|Diana Vine

Emot|Thinking

Fail|Fail2.3
Name|Diana Vine

Emot|Excited

Fail|Fail2.4
Name|Judge
Text|That's a contraction, not a contradiction. I think you need a new dictionary.
